# Establish serial communications with the water bath. Instrument interface menu
# recommend 19200 baud, 8-N-1, no flow control. No linefeeds (\n) should be
# used in the communications with the water bath, only carriage returns (\r). 
# Useful commands for the water bath: 
# RS\r = get current setpoint temperature
# RT\r = get current internal bath temperature
# SS xx.xx\r = change bath setpoint (i.e. SS 25.50, units of degrees Celsius)
# SE1 = turn on command echo. It seems counterintuitive, but this seems to be
#         necessary for this script to run.

# Begin by establishing a serial connection with the bath. The entry COM1 below
# will need to be changed to suit your specific serial port name. On a Mac this
# will be something like dev/tty.usbserial-xxxxxxx, on Windows it will be a
# COM port like COM1. 

#if running python from cygwin use this set of commands to figure out the port:
# import serial.tools.list_ports
# print([comport.device for comport in serial.tools.list_ports.comports()])
# for example on Dowd Mytilus laptop it returns ['/dev/ttyS9']
